# Movie Recommender using Content Filtering
__Libraries:__ pandas, numpy

In this project, I build a movie recommender using content filtering. This means that given a movie, it recommends other movies to the user based on similar content (description, keywords, cast, crew, etc...). Uses the TMDB 5000 Movie dataset. 

The dataset is stored in this repository, but can also be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
