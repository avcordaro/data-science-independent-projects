In this time series project, I attempt to build a LTSM model for one-step prediction. I will focus on forecasting the global average land temperature using the Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature dataset. This dataset contains daily global temperature readings from 1750 to 2015, as well as for individual countries.

The dataset is stored in this repository, but can also be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalTemperatures.csv
