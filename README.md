# Data Science Independent Projects - Python
A portfolio of my independent data science projects using Python, involving data visualisation, cleaning and building models. Libraries used include pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, tensorflow and sklearn.

The list of projects is as follows:

* __Amazon US Stock Market Prediction (Keras/Tensorflow)__ - attempting to build two LTSM models, one for one-step prediction, and one multi-step prediction of Amazon's closing stock market value.

* __Detecting Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays (PyTorch)__ - attempting to build a visualisation model that can predict whether a patient has pneumonia from their chest x-ray.

* __Movie Recommender using Collaborative Filtering (pandas)__ - building a movie recommender using collaborative filtering. In this instance, this means that movies are recommended based on user ratings.

* __Movie Recommender using Content Filtering (pandas)__ - building a movie recommender using content filtering. This means that given a movie, it recommends other movies to the user based on similar content (description, keywords, cast, crew, etc...).

* __Predicting Flight Arrival Delays (scikit-learn)__ - attempting to build a model that can predict the arrival delay of flights, using information available at take-off, for the The U.S. Department of Transportation's 2015 Domestic Flights dataset.

* __Predicting Winners of Diamond Ranked Matches in League of Legends (scikit-learn)__ - attempting to build a model that can predict the winners of diamond ranked matches in the very popular competitive strategy game, League of Legends. 

* __Recognising Blood Cell Types from Sample Images (Keras/Tensorflow)__ - attempting to build a visualisation model that can recognise and classify blood cell types, from images of blood cell samples. 

* __Recognising Sign Language Hand Gestures (Keras/Tensorflow)__ - attempting to build a visulation model that can accurately recognise sign language hand gestures (from Amercian Sign Language) and map them to the letters in the alphabet that they represent.

* __Sentiment Analysis on Musical Instrument Reviews (scikit-learn/spaCy/Keras)__ - attempting to build a model that can predict the overall star rating (1 to 5) of a review for a musical instrument, based on the review text written by a user. In addition, attempting to build a model that can classify the sentiment of the review between positive and negative, based on the review text.
