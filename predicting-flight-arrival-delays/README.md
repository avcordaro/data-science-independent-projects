# Predicting Flight Arrival Delays
In this project, I attempt to build a model that can predict the arrival delay of flights, using information available at take-off, for the The U.S. Department of Transportation's 2015 Domestic Flights dataset.

The dataset is too large to be stored in this repository, but can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays

You will have to download the dataset and extract the .csv files into this folder if you wish to try re-running the notebook code.
