# Amazon US Stock Market Prediction
__Libraries:__ tensorflow, keras, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

In this time series project, I attempt to build two LTSM models. One for one-step prediction, and one for multi-step prediction. I will focus on predicting Amazon's closing stock market value using the Huge Stock Market Dataset that contains years of historical data for all US-based stocks. 

The dataset is stored in this repository, but can also be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs
