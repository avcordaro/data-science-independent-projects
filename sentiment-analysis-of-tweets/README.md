# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
__Libraries:__ scikit-learn, re, pandas

In this project, I  attempt to build a model that can classify the sentiment of a tweet, between positive and negative. The dataset used contains 1.6million tweets. The purpose of this project is to gain experience in deploying this model onto a webpage using cloud services, so that it can forever be used to predict the sentiment of tweets.

The dataset is too large to be stored in this repository, but can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140
