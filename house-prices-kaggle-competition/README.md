# Predicting House Prices - Kaggle Competiton
__Libraries:__ scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, pandas, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

This is my attempt at Kaggle's House Prices competition, in which you have to predict the sale price of houses based on 79 features. The dataset is small but great for practicing techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and building powerful regression models.

The dataset is stored in this repository, but can also be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
