# Data Science Independent Projects
A portfolio of my independent data science projects, involving data visualisation, cleaning and building models. The list of projects is as follows:

* __Predicting Flight Arrival Delays__ - attempting to build a model that can predict the arrival delay of flights, using information available at take-off, for the The U.S. Department of Transportation's 2015 Domestic Flights dataset.
