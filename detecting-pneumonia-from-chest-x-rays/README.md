# Detecting Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays
__Libraries:__ PyTorch, scikit-learn, numpy, PIL, cv2, seaborn, matplotlib

In this project, I attempt to build a visualisation model that can predict whether a patient has pneumonia from their chest x-ray. The datatset used contains roughly 6000 images of chest x-rays, for which the patients either have pneumonia, or are completely healthy.  

The dataset is too large to be stored in this repository, but can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

You will have to download the dataset and extract the .csv files into this folder if you wish to try re-running the notebook code.
