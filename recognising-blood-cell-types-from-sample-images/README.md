# Recognising Blood Cell Types from Sample Images
__Libraries:__ tensorflow, keras, scikit-learn, cv2, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib

In this project, I attempt to build a visualisation model that can recognise and classify blood cell types, from images of blood cell samples. 

The dataset is too large to be stored in this repository, but can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells

You will have to download the dataset and extract the .zip into this folder if you wish to try re-running the notebook code.
