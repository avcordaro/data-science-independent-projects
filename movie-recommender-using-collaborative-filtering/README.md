# Movie Recommender using Collaborative Filtering
__Libraries:__ pandas, numpy

In this project, I build a movie recommender using collaborative filtering. In this instance, this means that movies are recommended via user ratings. To recommend movies to a certain user, they must have rated a number of movies they have seen. Then, the system will look for other users that have a similar set of ratings for the same movies. It will then recommend movies from the most similar users which the user has not seen. Uses the MovieLens 100k dataset. 

The dataset is stored in this repository, but can also be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/aigamer/movie-lens-dataset
