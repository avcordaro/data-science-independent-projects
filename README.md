# Data Science Independent Projects - Python
A portfolio of my independent data science projects using Python, involving data visualisation, cleaning and building models. Libraries used include pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, tensorflow and sklearn.

The list of projects is as follows:

* __Predicting Flight Arrival Delays__ - attempting to build a model that can predict the arrival delay of flights, using information available at take-off, for the The U.S. Department of Transportation's 2015 Domestic Flights dataset.

* __Predicting Winners of Diamond Ranked Matches in League of Legends__ - attempting to build a model that can predict the winners of diamond ranked matches in the very popular competitive strategy game, League of Legends. 

* __Recognising Sign Language Hand Gestures__ - attempting to build a visulation model that can accurately recognise sign language hand gestures (from Amercian Sign Language) and map them to the letters in the alphabet that they represent.

* __Recognising Blood Cell Types from Sample Images__ - attempting to build a visualisation model that can recognise and classify blood cell types, from images of blood cell samples.
