# Sentiment Analysis on Musical Instrument Reviews
__Libraries:__ tensorflow, keras, scikit-learn, numpy, spacy, seaborn, wordcloud, matplotlib

In this project, I attempt to build a model that can predict the overall star rating (1 to 5) of a review for a musical instrument, based on the review text written by a user. I also attempt to build a model that can classify the sentiment of the review between positive and negative, based on the review text. The dataset contains roughly 10,000 reviews from Amazon for musical instruments. 

The dataset is stored in this repository, but can also be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/eswarchandt/amazon-music-reviews
